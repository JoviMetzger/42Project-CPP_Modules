  <br>

 ## Module 05
Each of these exercises in the C++ module teaches you different aspects of C++ programming, including object-oriented programming, memory management, file handling, and more. 

### üî∏Exercise 00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
This exercise covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C++ and memory management. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Creation of a simple class with private attributes and member functions.
2. Memory management, including object creation on the stack and heap.
3. Practice with C++ class constructors and destructors.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 01 - Moar brainz!
This exercise focuses on creating pointers to objects and arrays.<br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Allocation and management of memory for an array of objects.
2. Usage of pointers to objects and arrays.
3. Initialization and utilization of objects within an array.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 02 - HI THIS IS BRAIN
This exercise explores pointers and references in C++ through string manipulation. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Understand the concept of pointers and references in C++.
2. Practice printing memory addresses and values of variables, pointers, and references.

**NOTE:**
- (*PTR) can change the value and the address without influencing the original variable.
- (&REF) can change the original value.
