# Module 04

## ðŸŒ€ Exercise 00
### Description
In this exercise you need to implements basic polymorphism. You will make a Animal base class with Dog and Cat derived classes, for each class you need to implementing makeSound(). <br>
Introduces WrongCat inheriting from WrongAnimal to demonstrate overriding behaviors.
<br>
### Installation
1. Compile the program:
```bash 
$ make 
```
2. Run the program with input:
```bash 
$ ./ex00
```
<br>
<br>

## ðŸŒ€ Exercise 01
### Description
Focuses on memory management and deep copying. Involves a Brain class and <br> both Dog and Cat classes have a private Brain* attribute.
<br>
### Installation
1. Compile the program:
```bash 
$ make 
```
2. Run the program:
```bash 
$ ./ex01
```
<br>
<br>

## ðŸŒ€ Exercise 02
### Description
Shifts focus to abstraction. Making it an **abstract class** (AAnimal).
<br>
### Installation
1. Compile the program:
```bash 
$ make 
```
2. Run the program:
```bash 
$ ./ex02
```
<br>
<br>

## ðŸŒ€ Exercise 03
### Description
Implements interfaces using abstract classes. Make an abstract class (*AMateria)*, <br> Ice and Cure as concrete classes inheriting from AMateria. <br>
Create **Character class** implementing the **ICharacter interface** and managing <br> an inventory of
AMateria instances. <br>
Introduces **MateriaSource class** responsible for learning and creating Materia instances.
<br>
### Installation
1. Compile the program:
```bash 
$ make 
```
2. Run the program:
```bash 
$ ./ex03
```
