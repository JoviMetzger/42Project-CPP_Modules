# Module 01

## üåÄ Exercise 01
### Description
This program demonstrates the distinction between Heap and Stack memory allocation.

`Heap allocation` is dynamic and requires manual memory management (e.g., malloc), while it persists beyond its original scope.
`Stack allocation` is managed automatically, existing only within the declaring scope.

```bash 
$ make 
```
2. Run the program with input:
```bash 
$ ./zombie
```
<br>
<br>

This exercise helps you understand how to manipulate and access data using pointers and references in C++.
<br>
### Installation
1. Compile the program:
```bash 
$ make 
```
2. Run the program:
```bash 
$ ./brain
```
<br>
<br>

## üåÄ Exercise 03

$ ./replace filename old_str new_str
```
<br>
<br>

## üåÄ Exercise 05
### Description
In this exercise, you'll automate a logging system with different log levels using pointers to member functions. <br>
**Choose from:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.
<br>
### Installation

```bash 
$ make 
```
2. Run the program:
```bash 
$ ./harl INFO
```
<br>
<br>

## üåÄ Exercise 06
### Description
This exercise focuses on filtering and displaying messages based on log levels and utilizing the switch statement in C++. <br>
**Select from:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`. <br>
<br>
### Installation

<br>
  
## Module 01
Each of these exercises in the C++ module teaches you different aspects of C++ programming, including object-oriented programming, memory management, file handling, and more. 

### üî∏Exercise 00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
This exercise is about string manipulation and basic C++ program structure. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Learn how to create a simple class in C++ with private attributes and member functions.
2. Practice memory management, including object creation on the stack and heap.
3. Gain experience with C++ class constructors and destructors.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 01 - Moar brainz!
This exercise focuses on creating a simple phonebook program in C++ and using classes.<br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Learn how to allocate and manage memory for an array of objects.
2. Practice using pointers to objects and arrays.
3. Gain experience in initializing and using objects within an array.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 02 - HI THIS IS BRAIN
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Understand the concept of pointers and references in C++.
2. Practice printing memory addresses and values of variables, pointers, and references.

**NOTE:**
A (*PTR) you can change the value and the address without having a influence on the original variable.
A (&REF) you can change the original value with.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 03 - Unnecessary violence
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Learn about classes and objects in C++.
2. Practice using constructors to initialize objects.
3. Gain experience with object composition and interactions.

**NOTE:**
HumanA Weapon (&REF) can't be NULL, it always needs a weapon.
HumanB Weapon (*PTR) can be NULL, so you can attack() without set_Weapon.
<br>

### üî∏Exercise 04 -  Sed is for losers
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Learn about file handling in C++.
2. Understand how to open, read, and write to files.
3. Practice string manipulation and replacement.
4. Gain experience in error handling and input validation.

**NOTE:**
Take care of:
```bash
$ ./replace infile "" "hello"
$ ./replace infile "bee" "bee"
$ ./replace infile "bee" "been"
$ ./replace wrong_infle "hello" "Hello"
```
<br>

### üî∏Exercise 05 - Harl 2.0
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Understand how to use pointers to member functions.
2. Practice implementing a logging system with different log levels.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 06 - Harl filter
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Learn how to use the switch statement in C++.
2. Understand how to filter and display messages based on log levels.
3. Gain experience in controlling program behavior using conditional statements.
