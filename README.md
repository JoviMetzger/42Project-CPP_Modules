  <summary><strong>Module 01:</strong> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(<strong>Topics:</strong> New, pointers to members, references, switch statement, Memory allocation)</em></summary>
  <br>

 ## Module 01
Each of these exercises in the C++ module teaches you different aspects of C++ programming, including object-oriented programming, memory management, file handling, and more. 

### üî∏Exercise 00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
This exercise covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C++ and memory management. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Creation of a simple class with private attributes and member functions.
2. Memory management, including object creation on the stack and heap.
3. Practice with C++ class constructors and destructors.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 01 - Moar brainz!
This exercise focuses on creating pointers to objects and arrays.<br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Allocation and management of memory for an array of objects.
2. Usage of pointers to objects and arrays.
3. Initialization and utilization of objects within an array.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 02 - HI THIS IS BRAIN
This exercise explores pointers and references in C++ through string manipulation. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Understand the concept of pointers and references in C++.
2. Practice printing memory addresses and values of variables, pointers, and references.

**NOTE:**
- (*PTR) can change the value and the address without influencing the original variable.
- (&REF) can change the original value.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 03 - Unnecessary violence
In this exercise, you'll work with classes and objects, emphasizing constructors and object interactions. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Learn about classes and objects in C++.
2. Practice using constructors to initialize objects.
3. Experience with object composition and interactions.

**NOTE:**
- For HumanA, Weapon (&REF) is required to/cannot be NULL; it always needs a weapon.
- For HumanB, Weapon (*PTR) can be NULL, allowing you to call attack() without setting the Weapon.
<br>

### üî∏Exercise 04 -  Sed is for losers

2. String manipulation and replacement.
3. Error handling and input validation.

**NOTE:** <br>
*Take care of:*
```bash
$ ./replace infile "" "hello"
$ ./replace infile "bee" "bee"
$ ./replace infile "bee" "been"
$ ./replace wrong_infile "hello" "Hello"
```
<br>

### üî∏Exercise 05 - Harl 2.0
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Usage of pointers to member functions in C++.
2. Implementation of a logging system with different log levels.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 06 - Harl filter
This exercise focuses on program behavior control using the switch statement and log filtering. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Application of the switch statement in C++.
2. Filtering and displaying messages based on log levels.
3. Gaining experience in controlling program behavior using conditional statements.

## üå†Orthodox Canonical Form

Implement the four required member functions:
- `Default constructor`
- `Copy constructor`
- `Copy assignment operator`
- `Destructor`

### üéÜ Default Constructor:

***Constructor();***
- A default constructor is a special member function of a class <br>
  that is called when an object is created without any arguments. <br>
- It initializes the object's data members, <br>
  to a default value (usually 0 or a specified value). <br>
- It's called automatically when you create an object of the class <br>
  without providing any explicit constructor arguments.

### üéÜ Copy Constructor:

***Constructor(const Constructor& value);***
- A copy constructor is a member function that creates a new object <br>
  by copying the values of another object of the same class.
- It's used to initialize a new object with the same data as an existing object.

### üéÜ Copy Assignment Operator Overload:

***Constructor& operator(const Constructor& value);***
- The copy assignment operator *(operator=)* is a member function <br>
  that allows you to assign the value of one object <br>
  to another object of the same class.
- It's used to make a deep copy of one object into another. <br>
- It is typically invoked when you use the assignment operator, <br>
  like obj1 = obj2, and ensures that obj1 now holds a copy of obj2's data.

**‚ùóNOTE:‚ùó** <br>
`obj1 = obj2:` *Should work.* <br>
`obj1 = obj2 = obj3:` *Should work.* <br>
`obj1 = obj1:` *Should **NOT** work.* <br>

### üéÜ Destructor:

***~Constructor();***
- A destructor is a special member function that is called when <br>
  an object is destroyed or goes out of scope.
- It is used to perform cleanup operations, <br>
  such as releasing resources or deallocating memory, <br>
  and is the opposite of a constructor.
<br>

## üå†Deep copy & Shallow copy

### üåò Deep Copy:
- A deep copy creates a new object that is a duplicate of the original object, <br>
and it recursively copies all the objects referenced by the original object.
- Deep copy ensures that the copy is fully independent of the original object. 
- **Any changes made to the copied object or its internal data won't affect the original object.**

### üåò Shallow Copy:
- A shallow copy, creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, <br>
but it doesn't recursively copy the objects referenced by the original.
- Instead, a shallow copy maintains references to the same objects as the original.
- Shallow copies are often faster and use less memory than deep copies <br>
because they don't replicate all the data and objects. 
- **Any changes in the copied object can affect the original object and vice versa.**
<br>

*In summary, the key distinction is that a deep copy creates a completely independent duplicate,* <br> 
*while a shallow copy shares some of the underlying data with the original object.*
<br>
<br>

## üå†Stack & Heap allocation

### üåõ Allocate on the Heap:
- The **heap** is created on the heap using dynamic memory allocation, <br>
  typically through the `new` operator in C++. 
- This means that the memory for the **heap** object is allocated on the heap, <br>
  and you need to manually deallocate it when you're done with it using `delete`. 
- Heap-allocated objects have a longer lifetime and exist <br>
  until explicitly freed by the programmer.
Example:
```c++
int	main()
{
	Heap *newHeap = new Heap("Bob");
	delete newHeap;
	return 0;
}
```

### üåõ Allocate on the Stack:
- Stack-allocated objects are automatically managed by the program's execution stack. 
- They have a shorter lifetime and are typically limited to the scope in which they are defined. 
- When the scope ends *(e.g., when the function returns)*, <br>
  the stack-allocated objects are automatically destroyed.
Example:
```c++
int	main()
{
	Stack newStack = Stack("Bob");
	return 0;
}
```
