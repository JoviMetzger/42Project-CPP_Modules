<br>
  
## Module 00
These exercises provide a range of practical skills and knowledge for working with C++ and building more complex programs, from basic string manipulation to object-oriented programming and debugging.

### üî∏Exercise 00 - Megaphone
This exercise is about string manipulation and basic C++ program structure. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Command-line argument handling in C++.
2. Converting strings to uppercase.
3. Creating a simple C++ program structure with Makefile.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 01 - My Awesome PhoneBook
This exercise focuses on creating a simple phonebook program in C++ and using classes.<br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including class design and encapsulation.
2. Input and output in C++, including formatting output.
3. Command-line interaction and implementing basic command parsing.
4. Memory management without dynamic allocation.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 02 - The Job Of Your Dreams
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Reverse engineering C++ code from header files and expected output.
2. Debugging and fixing C++ code to match specified requirements.
3. Understanding code functionality and relationships between different code files.

  <summary><strong>Module 01:</strong> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(<strong>Topics:</strong> New, pointers to members, references, switch statement, Memory allocation)</em></summary>
  <br>

 ## Module 01
Each of these exercises in the C++ module teaches you different aspects of C++ programming, including object-oriented programming, memory management, file handling, and more. 

### üî∏Exercise 00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
This exercise covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C++ and memory management. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Creation of a simple class with private attributes and member functions.
2. Memory management, including object creation on the stack and heap.
3. Practice with C++ class constructors and destructors.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 01 - Moar brainz!
This exercise focuses on creating pointers to objects and arrays.<br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Allocation and management of memory for an array of objects.
2. Usage of pointers to objects and arrays.
3. Initialization and utilization of objects within an array.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 02 - HI THIS IS BRAIN
This exercise explores pointers and references in C++ through string manipulation. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Understand the concept of pointers and references in C++.
2. Practice printing memory addresses and values of variables, pointers, and references.

**NOTE:**
- (*PTR) can change the value and the address without influencing the original variable.
- (&REF) can change the original value.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 03 - Unnecessary violence
In this exercise, you'll work with classes and objects, emphasizing constructors and object interactions. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Learn about classes and objects in C++.
2. Practice using constructors to initialize objects.
3. Experience with object composition and interactions.

**NOTE:**
- For HumanA, Weapon (&REF) is required to/cannot be NULL; it always needs a weapon.
- For HumanB, Weapon (*PTR) can be NULL, allowing you to call attack() without setting the Weapon.
<br>

### üî∏Exercise 04 -  Sed is for losers
This exercise involves file handling and string manipulation, requiring you to recreate a missing source file <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Handling files in C++ without using C file manipulation functions.
2. String manipulation and replacement.
3. Error handling and input validation.

**NOTE:**
*Take care of:*
```bash
$ ./replace infile "" "hello"
$ ./replace infile "bee" "bee"
$ ./replace infile "bee" "been"
$ ./replace wrong_infle "hello" "Hello"
```
<br>

### üî∏Exercise 05 - Harl 2.0
In this exercise, you are tasked with recreating a missing source file based on provided header files and a log file. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Usage of pointers to member functions in C++.
2. Implementation of a logging system with different log levels.

<br>

### üî∏Exercise 06 - Harl filter
This exercise focuses on program behavior control using the switch statement and log filtering. <br>
**You'll learn or practice:**
1. Application of the switch statement in C++.
2. Filtering and displaying messages based on log levels.
3. Gaining experience in controlling program behavior using conditional statements.
